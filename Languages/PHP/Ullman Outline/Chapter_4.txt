Introduction to MySQL
-MySQL is world's most popular oper-source database application
	-according to MySQL website
-When creating a database:
	-three general data types of MySQL
		-text, numeric, date/time
	-use names (identifiers) that are clear, meaningful, and easty to type
		-should contain only letters, numbers, and underscores
		-should not be the same as an existing keyword
		-should be treated as case-sensitive
		-cannot be longer than 64 characters (actually bytes)
		-must be unique within its domain
			-two columns or two tables cannot have the same name
	-database name should be unique to MySQL server
		-tables names should be unique within database
			-colum names should be unique within each table
	-always work with one case and as if case sensitivity applied
	-determine correct data type -- reference page on 115
		-specifying length and passing a value that is more than length will result in truncation
		-length should correspond to largest possible numerical value or longest string
	-special data types: enum and set
		-enum: can store only one value of a possible several thousand
		-set: allows for up to 64 possible values
	-determine correct sub-type to set even more constraints on the range
	-char vs. varchar
		-char pads unused memory with spaces
		-varchar uses only the size of passed string
	-DECIMAL type is preferred if absolute precision is necessary
	-TINYINT(1) is the equivalent of boolean in SQL -- 1 and 0
		-BINARY,VARBINARY,TINYBLOB,MEDIUMBLOB,LONGBLOB -- store binary data such as entire files or encrypted data
	-TIMESTAMP is usually automatically set to the day and time and update occurs
-column properties:
	-Null vs. Not null -- required || optional

-indexes and keys
	-index -- way of requesting that the database keep an eye on the values of a specific column or combination of columns
		-improves performance when retrieving records
	-key -- integral to normalization process used in design of complex databases 
		-primary -- artificial way to refer to a record and has to abide by three rules
			-it must always have a value
			-value must never change
			-value must be unique for each record in the table
		-foreign -- what the primary key connects to in another database
-values in columns can be preset -- generally good with a known number of values
	-col_name ENUM('val1','val2') default 'val1'
		-enum's default value is the first possible value
-ZEROFILL -- any extra room will be padded with zeroes
-defining column values:
	1) identify primary key
	2) identify what can be null
	3) make any numeric type unsigned if it will never be negative
	4) establish default value
	5) confirm definition
-text columns can have defined character sets and collations
-default values must be static
-TEXT columns cannot be assigned to default values (usually dynamic)

-accessing database out of command line
	-mysql -h hostname -p -- prompts to enter a password
	-after login to database -- USE test_database; -- specifies test_database for every subsequent command
