-sending an email using PHP:
	mail(to, subject, body, [headers])
	-takes additional 5th argument adding additional parameters to be sent to the mail-sending applications
	-to -- should be an email adress or series of addresses separated by commmas
		-example@domain.com | example@domain,example@domain,example@domain | Actual Name <example@domain> | Actual Name <example@domain>, Actual Name <example@domain> 
	-subject -- creates subject line of email
		-subject line cannot contain the new line characters
	-body -- contents of email
		-can span multiple lines
		-can use newline character in double quotations 
		-each line should be no longer than 70 characters
			-can be accomplishing using wordwrap()
			$body = wordwrap($boday, 70)
	-header can set:
		-From, Reply-To, Cc, Bcc
		ex) mail($to, $subject, $body, 'From: example@domain')
		-to use multiple separate headers with \r\n 
			$headers = "From: example@domain\r\n";
			$headers .= "Cc: example@domain\r\n";
			mail($to, $subject, $body, $header);
	-two things must be present when working
		-computer on which PHP is running must have a working mail server
			-should not be an issue on a hosted site
		-prevent spam attacks -- addressed in chapter 13
	-returns a 1 or a 0 based on success or failure
-handling file uploads
	-most all types of the possible forms can be handled similarly in PHP except file uploads
		-two necessary dimension:
			-HTML form must be displayed with the code to allow the upload
				-upon upload, server stores file temporarily in a directory
			-PHP must copy uploaded file to destination
	-server configurations:
		-PHP language itself
			-php.ini dictates how PHP handles uploads specifically stating how large of a file can be uploaded and where the upload should temporarily be stored
				-edit if any conditions apply:
					-file_uploads is disabled
					-PHP has no temporary directory to use
					-you will be uploading very large files
					-if using a hosted site, preconfigured settings are already present
		-configure locations and permissions of temporary directory
		-destination directory must also have the permissions established
			-see page 337
	-confirm server settings with phpinfo() command
		-verify that file_uploads has a value of on
		-limits on upload_max_filesize (2MB by default) and post_max_size(8MB) won't be a restriction
		-if running on windows -- see that upload_tmp_dir has a value
			-if not on windows value absence is still good to go
		-if necessary open php.ini in text editor
			-search to make any necessary edits in text editor
	-htdocs handles all uploaded files in the web directory -- create upload file directory outside of root directory to securely store uploaded data
		-set perimissions on uploads so that web directory can write data into the directory
		-in unix --correct permissions with chmod -- 775 or 777
		-due to time constraints use set_time_limit() or max_input_time value in php.ini
	-required form syntax to handle the upload
		<form enctype="multipart/form-data" action="script.php" method="post"><input type="hidden" name="MAX_FILE_SIZE" value="30000"/> File <input type="file" name="upload"/>
		-enctype tag indicates that it should handle multiple types of data including files
		-MAX_FILE_SIZE is a form on rectricting how large the chosen file should be allowed to be
		-once file is received:
			move_uploaded_file(temporary_filename,/path/to/destination/filename);
	-see script 11.2 -- MIME type indicates what kind the file is -- create an array of allowed options
	-once file is uploaded but didn't work on the being moved to proper server directory use the unlink() -- prior to use check that file exists()
	-excluding enctype attribute is a common reason of error creation
	-existince can be validated with is_uploaded_file() condition
	--move_uploaded_file() will overwrite existing file without warning if new and existing file both have the same name
-PHP and Javascript
	-Javascript is client side, PHP is server side so Javascript can detect things like browser window size, create pop-up window, make image mouseovers
	-PHP interacts with MySQL on the server but Javascript cannot
	-PHP can dynamically generate Javascript
	-using Javascript:
		<script type="text/javascript">
		//Actual Javascript code
		</scipt?
	-using external Javascript file or charset attribute:
		<script type="text/javascript" charset = "utf-8" src="somefile.js"></script>
	-javascript is only object oriented -- not like PHP which is both scripting and object oriented
	-different browsers have different attributes concerning size
-Understanding HTTP Headers
	-use a PHP proxy script to access the different images within the uploads directory when using the browser on client's side
	-header function is used to redirect the Web browser with many different jobs
	syntax: header(header string);
		-can be used to perform many tasks such as redirecting the web browser, sending files, creating cookies, controlling page caching, etc.
		header('Location: http://www.example.com/page.php'); -- sends browser to specified URL
		header("Content-Type:appliation/pdr\n"); --specifies MIME type in browser to let it know it is about to receive a pdf
		header("Content-Disposition:attachment; filename=\"somefile.pdf\"\n"); -- prompts the browser to download the file
		header("Content-Length: 4096\n"); -- corresponds to the length of data sent
	-NOTHING CAN BE SENT TO WEB BROWSER BEFORE USING HEADER FUNCTION
	-character set can be specified in PHP using:
	<?php header('Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8'); ?> as first line of web page that must be PHP script, before any HTML
	-a proxy script can only send one single file or image at a time
-Date and Time
	date_default_time_zone(tz)
	checkdate(month, day, year) -- returns true if date is in valid range (present or past)
	date(format, [timestamp]) -- timestamp is optional representing seconds since Unix Epoch (midnight January 1, 1970)
	get_date() -- returns an array of values with respect to a day and time
