20 AMI types (EBS vs Instance Store Backed)
-select based on:
	-region, OS, Architecture, launch permissions,
	storage for the root device:
		-instance store (Ephemeral Store)
		-EBS backed volumes

-Application:
	-launch EC2 instance, community AMIs, root device types at bottom, select instance store
		-additional Instance store volumes can be attached initially but not after launch
			-cannot even be encrypted
		-additional EBS volumes can be attached after launch
		-after launch, instance store volumes cannot be stopped, EBS can be stopped 
			-stopping is necessary for moving AMI around AWS
			-failed host would lose the instance because it can't be stopped in instance store
		-root device volume can be detached and reattached to different AMIs in EBS, not in instance store

-Summary:
	-all AMIs are categorized as either backed by amazon EBS or backed by instance store
	-EBS volumes: root device for an instance launched from the AMI is an EBS volume created from an EBS snapshot
		-can be stopped, if host fails, data can be recovered
		-can be rebooted without data loss
	-Instance store volumes: root device is launched from the AMI is an instance store volume created form a template stored in s3
		-called ephemeral storage
		-cannot be stopped, if host fails, data is lost
		-can be rebooted without data loss
	-by default, both ROOT volumes will be deleted upon termination, however with EBS volumes, you can tell AWS to keep the root device volume
