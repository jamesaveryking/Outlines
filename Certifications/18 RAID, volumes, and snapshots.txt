18 Raid, volumes, and snapshots
RAID: redundant array of independent disks
-multiple disks for OS and functions
-RAID 0: striped, no redundancy, good performance, single volume created across all disks, if one disk fails all disk fails
-RAID 1: mirrored, redundancy, if one disk fails others do not
-RAID 5: 3+ disks writing parity to another disk, aws does not ever recommend putting RAID 5's on EBS
-RAID 10: combo of 1 and 0, striping as well as mirroring, good redundancy, good performance
-use RAID when single volume is provisioned to max size, add multiple volumes and create RAID arrays, usually 0 or 10 on AWS
-ex question) third party large DB: configure multiple volumes in a RAID array

to create:
-add RDP in security groups (3389) from anywhere or just My IP
-go to EC2 dashboard
-launch instance in the free tier windows server 2012 R2 t2 micro all default
-add multiple additional volumes
-RDPs will be added access via security group in step one
-view instance after it loads, windows takes longer than Linux to load
-login to EC2 instance via RDP using username administrator and password from platform
	-click on instance, actions, get windows password, cut and paste private key, decrypt password, copy and paste into RDP 
-after RDP into server, look at the file explorer to verify additional volumes
-go to disk management in windows
-delete all volumes 
-right click on available volumes, right click and select select as striped volume 
	-next next, assign derive letter, performer quick format, NTFS, next, finished

to take snapshot:
-problem: excludes data held in cache, can be problem of interdepence in RAID array
-take an application consistent snapshot, flush all caches on the disk
	-how?
		-freeze the file system
		-unmount the RAID array
		-shutting down the associated EC2 instance -- easiest

-****improve IOs by creating RAID through additional EBS volumes ****
