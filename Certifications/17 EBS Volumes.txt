17 EBS Volumes
-always have EBS volume and EC2 instance in the same AZ
-standard volume can't be modified, it's the oldest and magnetic
	-everything else can be modified on the fly
-to create in another AZ:
	-create a snapshot of EC2 instance volume in volumes portion of EC2 instance to later launch as a new AMI
	-actions under snapshots after creation from volumes:
		-change AZ, attach new EC2 instance, **copy AMI to another region in the world**, etc.
-exam tips:
-EBS volumes are a virtual hard disk drive
-root disk volume is where the OS is installed
-snapshots exist on S3
-snapshots are point in time copies of the volume
-snapshots are incremental, only blocks that have changed are moved to S3
-first snapshots take time
-best practice to stop instance before snapshot, however it is possible while running
-you can create AMI's from both volumes and snapshots
-you can change EBS sizes on the fly, as well as changing the size and storage type
-volumes will ALWAYS be in the same availability zone as the EC2 instance
	-never in different AZ's due to latency
-to move EC2 volume from one AZ/region to another take a snapshot then copy it to the new AZ/region
-snapshots of encrypted volumes are encrypted automatically
-volumes restored from encrypted snapshots are automatically encrypted
-only unencrypted snapshots can be shared or made public
