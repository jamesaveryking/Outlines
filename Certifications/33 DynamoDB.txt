33 DynamoDB
-fast, flexible nosql db services for fast latency at any scale
-best for IOT, mobile, gaming
-stored on ssd storage
-spread across 3 geographically distinct data centers (facilities) NOT AZ's
	-redundancy built in
	-different consistency models
		-eventually consistent reads
			-reads reaching within 1 second
			-used when immediate read is not necessary
		-strongly consistent reads
			-reflects all writes that were successful prior to the read
-pricing
	-writing and reading
		-writing: based on every 10 units
		-reading: based on every 50 units
-1 write capacity unit can handle 1 write per second (1000000 writes per day needs 12 consistency units (1000000/24/60/60 = 11.4)
-expensive for writes, cheap for reads
-columns can be added dynamically
	-different from RDS because values would have to be null
-read and write capacity units can also be added dynamically
	-in RDS, snapshot must be created and instance size must be increased
