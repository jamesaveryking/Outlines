35 Elasticache
-two different engines
	-memcached
		-widely adopted memory object caching system, protocol compliant
	-redis
		-open-source, in-memory in key value store supporting sorted sets and lists, supports master/slave replication, multi a-z across availability zones for redundancy
-elasticache: web service that makes easy deploying, scaling, and keeping in-memory cache in the cloud
	-stores most popular queries to cut down on database latency and improve throughput
	-can be used for compute-intensive workloads
	-can include results of computational intensity or large IO DB workloads
tips:
	-given scenario where DB is under stress, which services can alleviate?
		-read-heavy and not prone to changing -- elasticache
		-mgmt using analytics? -- redshift
		-read-replicas? RDS
