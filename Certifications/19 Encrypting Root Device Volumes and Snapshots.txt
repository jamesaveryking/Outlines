19 Encrypting root device volumes and snapshots

-look at EC2 instances
-stop desired instances
-go to volumes
-take a snapshot of the volume through action - create snapshot
-couple of things can be done:
	-copy snapshot to another region or AZ, option to encrypt snapshot appears
		-change region to view
		-actions -- create image of snapshot, create 
			-upon creation, can be used to boot servers from, root device is now encrypted
		-launch
		-root device volume will now be encrypted upon viewing

		
-AWS marketplace in launching EC2 shows available third party AMIs that can be bought (Firewalls, etc. rented by hour)


-Review:
	-to create snapshot of EBS always stop the instances
	-snapshots of encrypted volumes are encrypted automatically
	-volumes restored from encrypted snapshots are encrypted automatically
	-only unencrypted snapshots can be shared
		-snapshots can be shared with AWS accounts or made public
