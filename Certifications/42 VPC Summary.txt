42 VPC Summary
-start by building private VPC with public and private subnets
	-NAT gateways
	-Route Tables with no public route out, new route table for public traffic using internet gateways
NAT Instances:
	-disable source and destination check
	-must be in public subnet
	-there must be a route out of the private subnet to the NAT instance in order for it to work
	-the amount of traffic that NAT instances can support depends on the size of the instance, if bottlenecking increase the instance size
	-create highly available NAT instances using autoscaling groups, mutliple subnets in different AZs, and a script to automate failover
	-must be behind a security group
NAT Gateways:
	-preferred by enterprise
	-scale up automatically to 10 Gb/s
	-no need to patch
	-not associated with security groups
	-no static public ip address
	-remember to update route tables
	-no need to disable source/destination checks
	-more secure than NAT instance -- amazon patches
NACLs
	-VPC contains default NACL allowing all inbound and outbound traffic
	-custom NACLs deny all traffic by default
	-subnets must be associated with NACL, default NACL by default
	-you can associate a NACL with multiple subnets but not multiple NACLs per subnet
	-rules executed in order from least to greatest
	-NACLs have separate inbound and outbound rules for traffic -- stateless because it has to work on both
	-can block IP addresses unlike security groups
Application Load Balancers:
	-you will need at least two public subnets to deploy
VPC Flow Logs
	-must be VPCs in same account
	-cannot tag a flow log
	-assocations to IAM can't be changed
	-not all traffic is monitored (see file)
VPC Endpoints
	-private communication within VPC to connect to S3 without public IP address
