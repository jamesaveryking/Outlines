S3 encrytion & security
-by default all newly created buckets are private
-you can set up access using:
	-ACLs
	-Bucket Policies
-S3 buckets can be configured to create access logs which log all requests made to S3 bucket
-methods of encryption for S3:
	-in transit: SSL/TLS, when information is being sent to/from
	-at rest:
		-server side
			-S3 managed keys: each object encrypted with unique key for strong multifactor encryption, keys encrypted with master keys
				-Advanced Encryption Standard 256 (AES 256)
			-AWS KMS managed keys: key management service, additional charges, separate permissions for envelope key to access keys
				-provides audit trail of when/who used keys
				-option to create and manage keys yourself or default key 
			-server side encryption with customer encryption keys: SSE - C, management of key is done by the client
		-client side: encrypt before upload
