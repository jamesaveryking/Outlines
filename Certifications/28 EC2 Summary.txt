28 EC2 Summary
-read FAQ
-know difference between:
	-on-demand, spot, reserved, dedicated hosts
	-remember with spot instances if you terminate instance you will pay for the entire rest of the hour but if AWS terminates the hour is free
-know EC2 instance types:
	-dr mcgift pix
		-d for dense storage
		-r for RAM
		-m for general purpose
		-c for compute optimized (CPU)
		-g for graphics -- video encoding
		-i for IOPS -- high speed storage (NOSQL dbs)
		-f for field programmable -- hardware acceleration
		-t for testing, lowest cost
		-p for pictures, GPUs machine learning, bitcoin mining
		-x for xtreme RAM
-EBS
	-SSD general purpose up to 10000 IOPS
	-SSD provisioned IOPS up to 20000 and greater than 10
	-HDD throughput optimized -- sequential writes frequently accessed workloads
	-HDD cold -- less frequently accessed data for file servers
	-HDD magnetic standard -- same as cold except it CAN be a boot volume
	-cannot mount 1 EBS volume to multiple EBS instances, for this use EFS
-EC2
	-termination protection turned off by default
	-default action of EBS root volume where OS is installed is deletion upon termination but can be turned off
	-root volumes can't be encrypted by default except with third party software but additional volumes can
-volumes and snapshots
	-volumes exist on EBS as virtual harddisks
	-snapshots exist on S3
		-you can take a snapshot of a volume, this will store that volume on S3
	-snapshots are point in time copies of volumes
	-snapshots are incremental, only save changes to previous snapshots not the entire snapshot, to S3
	-first snapshot takes time
-security
	-snapshots of encrypted volumes encrypted automatically
	-volumes restored from encrypted snapshots are encrypted automatically
	-you can share snapshots but only if they are no encrypted
		-these snapshots can be shared with AWS accounts or marketplace
-root device volumes
	-stop instance before taking snapshot
	-instance store volumes -- ephemeral -- if underlying host fails data is lost, can be rebooted not stopped
	-EBS volumes can be stopped without data loss 
		-can also be rebooted
	-by default, both root volumes will be deleted upon termination, however with EBS volumes you can tell aws to keep the root device volume
-raid array snapshot
	-excludes data held by cache -- problem with interdepency in multiple volume array
	-stop application from writing to disk and flush cache on disk
		-3 ways to flush:
			-freeze file system
			-unmount raid array
			-shut down associated EC2 instance
-AMI tips:
	-amis are regional, only launch from region where it is stored
	-can be copied using dashboard tools or EC2 API as well as command line
-cloudwatch:
	-standard: 5 minutes
	-detailed: 1 minutes
	-for performance monitoring, cloudtrail is for auditing
	-dashboards, alarms for thresholds and autoscaling, events, logs
-roles:
	-more secure than access keys on individual ec2 instances
	-roles are easier to manage
	-can be assigned to ec2 instance after it is provisioned
	-role policy can be updated anytime
	-roles are universal
-instance metadata
	-used to get info on instance (public/private IP)
	-curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/metadata
-EFS
	-supports NFSv4
	-only pay for storage, no pre-provisioning
	-30 cents/gig
	-scales to peta
	-supports thousands of NFSv4 connections
	-read after write consistency
	-stored across multiple AZ's within region
-lambda
	-serverless
	-compute service to upload code and create function, aws takes care of provisioning and services
	-put code into cloud without servers/OS
	-event driven (changes to data is S3 through upload, etc.) or compute service response to HTTP requests using API Gateway or API calls to SDK's
