Cloudfront content delivery network
CDN: system of distributed servers that deliver web content to user based on location and data needed
	-cuts down on latency
Key Terminology:
-edge location: location where content will be cached
	-separate than availability zone or region
	-not for read only, can be written to as well to be replicated to origin
	-objects cached for length of TTL
	-cache can be cleared but there is a charge
-origin: origin of all files that the CDN will distribute - can be S3, EC2, Elastic Load Balancer, or Route53
-distribution: name given to CDN which consists of a collection of edge locations
	-can have multiple origins in single distribution
-web distribution: typically used for "streaming" websites
-RTMP: used for streaming adobe flash
Methodology:
-user makes request to edge location URL
-edge location sees if object is cached at that particular location
	-if cached, loads
	-if not, pulls down object from S3 or other and caches it to the edge location for the specified time to live
-further requests pull loaded file from edge location until time to live expires
-first user only suffers performance penalty

-can be used to deliver entire website to edge location
-designed to work with other services, works also with non-AWS origin server
