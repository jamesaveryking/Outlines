	-samples data and automatically analyzes for compression scheme
	-massive parallel processing -- distributes data across all nodes
-starts out with single node of 160 GB
	-multinode configuration for scale
		-leader node and compute nodes, up to 128 compute nodes, stores and does computation on data
-pricing:
	-compute node hours - 1 unit per node per hour, doesn't include leader only compute nodes
	-backup
	-data transfer (only within VPC)
-security:
	-every communication encrypted by SSL and at rest using AES
	-default key management, but can be changed to user via console
