Connection Characteristics

-Analog and Digital Modulation:
	-analog modulation -- send an analog signal over and analog channel (AM and FM audio over radio frequencies)
		-distance leads to static
	-digital modulation - send a digital bitstream over analog channel (digital audio over satellite radio frequencies)
		-all or nothing in terms of success
		-higher frequency is 1, lower frequency is 0
-Distance limitations:
	-regardless of copper, fiber, wireless all signals degraade
	-often set of standards to describe device type and connection length
		-you can sometimes go farther
	-always need advaced testing to measure signal
-Data transfer speeds
	-data between A and B and how quickly transmission occurs
	-rarely straightforward
		-bytes used to measure local device storage
		-bits used to measure transmission across medium
	-SATA storage
		-uses 8b/10b signaling - takes 10 bits across wire to make 8 bits
		-SATA revision 3.0 wire communication is 6 gigabits/second or 750 megabytes/second
		-actual data transfer is 600 megabytes/second because of 8b/10b signal (80% of 750)
-Quality:
	-signal strength (how loud)
		-how much is getting to other side
	-signal quality of the noise -- how much of it is any good?/
		-there will always be a signal-to-noise ratio
	-important for network communication
		-there are many ways to affect quality
		-important on wires, fibers, and wireless
		-physical medium is exceptionally important
-Digital Rights Management (DRM)
	-control over digital media by owner
	-associated with games, videos, movies, documents
	-can be software or hardware
		-USB key for software
	-every application is different
		-some DRM implementations better than others
		-be aware when moving computers around or replacing hardware
-Frequencies
	-number of cycles in a second (hertz)
		-faster speeds = faster frequencies
	-Ex) Gigabit internet
		-category 5 cables certified to 125 MHz
		-1000Base-T gigabit ethernet codes two bits per signal
		-uses four pair simultaneously
		-125 MHz * 2 bits/signal * 4 pair = 1000 megabits/second
	-802.11 wireless
		-2.4 GHz and 5GHz frequencies
	-Optical
		-represented as wavelength (850 nanometers) (common way to describe frequencies)
