Overview of Raid

Redundant Array of Independent Disks
-also inexpensive disks -- modern is independent
-different RAID levels
	-some redundant, some not
-RAID 0 - striping
-RAID 1 - Mirroring
-RAID 5 - Striping with Parity
-Nested RAID - RAID 1+0 (aka RAID 10)
	-a stripe of mirror drives

-software vs. hardware based
	-software - built into OS, no special hardware or hardware controllers
		-performance varies based on other OS tasks
	-hardware - add piece of hardware to motherboard or adapter card
		-handles all rate performance/management
		-configured outside of OS, usually invisible to operating system
		-high performance and designed for speed
		-tends to be faster than software
-RAID 0 - striping
	-file blocks are split between two or more physical drives
		-info layered between 2+ physical drives
		-high performance - high writing speed
		-no redundancy -- drive failure breaks the array because of layering
-RAID 1 - mirroring because it is an EXACT duplicate of the data
	-at least two drives are necessary
	-instead of splitting drives the drives are duplicated
	-high disk utilization -- every file is duplicated
	-absolutely redundant between drives -- every drive has exact duplicate
	-easier recovery because of exact duplication
	-requires twice the space
-RAID 5 - striping plus parity bit
	-striping across multiple disks over at least 3 disks
	-not an exact duplicate 
	-parity disk allows data to be recreated even if one of the drives is lost
	-parity calculation may affect performance when drive is lost due to limited state
-RAID 1+0 - a stripe of mirrors
	-speed of striping with redundancy of mirroring
	-need at least 4 drives
	-best of both worlds
	-RAID 0 across every set of two drives written using RAID 1 as a pair
