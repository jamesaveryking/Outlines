Overview of IPv4 and IPv6

-internet protocol version 4
	-OSI layer 3 address
	-since one byte is 8 bits the maximum decimal value for each byte is 255
	-8 bits = 1 byte = 1 octet
	-max number is 255 in each octet
internet protocol version 6
	-340 undecillion potential addresses
	-128-bit address
	-represented in hexadecimal instead of decimal
	-each address is 16 bits, total address is 16 bytes
	-DNS will become important
	-first 64 bits is usually network prefix
	-last 64 bits is usually the host network addresses
	-group of zeroes can be abbreviated with a double colon
		-only one allowed per address
	-steps to compess address:
		1) remove leading zeroes
		2) locate largest group of 2 or more zeros only and replace with double colon
public vs. private addresses in ipv4
	-RFC 1918 addresses used privately and not routed over internet
automatic private IP addressing (APIPA)
	-linked-local address -- communicating locally not outside of network
	-used when private addresses are not assigned via DHCP
	-uses ARP to confirm address isn't currently in use
ipv6 link-local address
	-non-routable local network address
	-required on ever ipv6 enabled interface
		-many addresses per interface
	-fe80::/10 with only one subnet allocate (all zeroes)
	-last 64 bits usually created with a modified EUI-64
		-based on MAC address
