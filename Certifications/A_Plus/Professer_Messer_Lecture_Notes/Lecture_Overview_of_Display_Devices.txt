Overview of Display Devices

-Liquid Crystal Display
	-light shines through crystals and color filter
	-work at molecular level where liquid crystals are twisted show that they will shine light through polarized filters
	-requires backlight to shine through light-emitting diodes
	-two kinds:
		-Twisted Nematic LCD
			-most common
			-fast response times 1-2 milliseconds
			-low power draw
			-small viewing angle
			-gaming
		-In Plane Switching LCD
			-excellent color representation
			-no tailing when touched -- mobile
			-more expensive to produce than TN
			-graphics development
	-backlights:
		-fluorescent vs. LED backlight
			-CCFL -- cathode color fluorescent lamp
				-high voltage and power needed
				-used a power inverter for DC to AC power
				-added thickness to display
				-no longer a common backlight
				-older technologies
			-LED-backlit LCD display
				-backlight is LEDs instead of fluorescent
				-LEDS around edge of screen
					-diffused to evenly light display
				-an array of LEDs behind screen
					-may be dimmed individually
			-Plasma display
				-display of tiny cells containing noble gas and mercury
				-adding voltage forms plasma -- mercury sheds energy as UV light
		
		-UV light strikes color phosphor
				-deep blacks, fast response time
				-no longer in production
	-Digital Projectors
		-not always LCD but common to see LCD in name
		-metal-halide lamp:
			-very bright and very hot light
			-relatively expensive
			-always let bulb completely cool so fan can gradually cool down lamp
	-Organic Light Emitting Diode -- OLED
		-organic compound emits light when receiving an electric current
		-thinner and lighter -- flexible/mobile - no glass needed
		-no backlight -- organic compound provides the light - true black color
		-lifespan may be shorter than LED because of organic materials
