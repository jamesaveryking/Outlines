Understanding Laser Printers

-combine a laser, high voltage charged ions, powdered ink, heat and paper
-very high quality
-better speeds
-very complex:
	-requires on printer memory
	-mess/heat on inside
-imaging drum
	-photosensitive drum painted by laser
	-picks up toner and transfers to paper
	-can be separate from the other toner cartridge or combined
	-ex) imaging drum in middle, toner on top
	-do not expose imaging drum to light
-fuser assembly
	-heat and pressure to melt plastic toner powder to attach to paper permaanently
-transfer belt and roller
	-color laser printers: cyan, yellow, black, magenta
	-four separate toner cartridges
		-separate photoreceptive drums
	-image is transferred from all cartridges to the single belt and then to a single transfer roller
-pickup rollers -- take single page at a time all the way through printer
	-should be periodically cleaned or replaced
	-problem occurs if no or multiple paper is picked up
	-usually a rubbery substance with resistance on them to pick up paper
-separation pad:
	-pull just top sheet of paper from tray
	-relatively small and inexpensive
-duplexing assembly
	-prints both sides of paper
	-sends paper through, flips inside, prints paper
	-can be built into printer or built on to printer
-steps in print:
	1)processing - constructs page in memory
	2)charging - wire sets negative charge to photosensitive drum
	3)exposing - laser puts image on photosensitive drum through contrast with negative ions
	4)developing - toner applied to phosensitive drum and toner is negatively charged
		-toner sticks to where laser created contrast
	5)transferring - toner placed onto paper
	6)fusing -- apply heat and pressure to mealt toner on page
	7)cleaning -- removes toner from phosensitive drum
		-drum could be needed multiple times depending on complexity of image
