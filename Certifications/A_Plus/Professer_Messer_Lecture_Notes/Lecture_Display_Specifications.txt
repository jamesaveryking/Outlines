Display Specifications

-old version -- Cathode Ray Tubes
	-electron beam would charge phosphorous in tubes a certain number of times per second
		-called refresh rate -- b/c phosphourous was constantly refreshed
		-measure in Hertz because it is a frequency
-LCD displays -- frame rate
	-no electron beams
	-refreshes entire screen - still measured in Hz
		-60Hz 120Hz 144 Hz
		-really a frame rate
	-everything on screen changes instantly and uniformly
-Resolution:
	-number of available pixels to view in (W*H)
	-aspect ratio -- looks at ratio of width to heighth
		-standard monitor aspect ratio -- 4:3
			-1600 x 1200 || 2048 x 1536
		-wide screen monitor -- 16:10
			-1920 x 1200 || 2560 x 1600
		-HD -- 16:9
			-1920 x 1080 || 2560 x 1440
	-native resolution
		-LCD display is fixed -- number of pixels does not change
		-display looks best when the video settings match a display's native resolution
			-mismatch can cause distortion
		-if necessary to change try to use resolution to ratio of display
-Brightness -
	-Luminance
		-measured Candela per square meter (cd/m**2)
		-more is beter
	-Lumens
		-an ANSI test
		-3000 lumens works in a dim room
		-6000 lumens works in a sunlit room
-analog vs. digital
	-analog -- one continuous signal
		-VGA video or DE-15 interface
		-DVI-A
	-digital -- transmitted as discrete values
		-DVI-D (digital visual interface)
		-HDMI (high-definition multimedia interface)
-display filters
	-privacy -- fades screen to black or gold used on laptops
		-placed on front of display
		-common to see on planes
	-anti-glare
		-reduce glare
		-improve viewing
		-useful in bright light
-multiple displays
	-optimizes work environment
	-extends a desktop
		-each display is independent
		-location is determined by OS
