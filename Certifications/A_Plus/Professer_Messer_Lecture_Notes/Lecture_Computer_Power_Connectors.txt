Computer Power Connectors

Normal power supplies have multiple available connectors

-modern devices tend to be SATA connected devices (15 pin connection)
	-15 pins -- 3.3V, 5V, 12V wires
		-3.3V rarely used by most drives

-Molex connectors
	-4-pin peripheral power connectors
		-Molex Connector Company
		-AMP Mate-N-Lok
		-provides 12V and 5V
	-power for many devices in the computer case
		-storage devices
		-optical drives
		-fans
		-other peripherals

-older motherboards: 4-pin ATX 12V
	-additional 12V power for older motherboards
	-may be labeled ATXV12, P4, or CPU
	-keyed for the appropriate connector on motherboard
		-pins specific

-8 pin EPS 12V power
	-entry level power supply specification EPS12V
	-4+4 connector -- includes ATX 12V 4-pin
	-created to provide 12V power to multiple CPUs -- mostly on servers
	-NOT 8-pin PCI express power -- keyed different and will not work without breaking motherboard connection

-PCI3 6-pin and 8-pin power
	-used for expansion cards
	-6-pin (75 watts), 8-pin (150 watts)
	-provides 12V
	-commonly seen on high-power components -- video adapters
	-can be 6 OR 8 pin modular connections

-20-pin or 24-pin motherboard power
	-probably largest power connector on motherboard -- provides power to entire motherboard
	-provides 3.3V, 5V, 12V
	-20 pin was original ATX standard
	-24 was added for PCI express power
	-24 pin can be used on 20 pin -- designed to be backwards-compatible
