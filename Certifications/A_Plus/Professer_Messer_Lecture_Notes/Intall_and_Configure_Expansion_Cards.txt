-Data centers use small computers that are connected by Riser Cards - connects card larger than computer to smaller server computers by using riser card connected to bus of computer to turn card 90 degrees - not limited anymore by height
-before any modifications always check motherboard documentation to check number and type of slots, necessary drivers, minimum software/hardware requirements, etc.
-always check forums to see exact process (driver then card or card then driver - subjective to hardware)
-driver installation is straightforward - install driver into OS to allow access to additional card
		-check web for later installation
		-new drivers may require uninstall of old drivers
		-manufactureres usually provide setup program
		-manual installatio could require windows device manager - RESEARCH
