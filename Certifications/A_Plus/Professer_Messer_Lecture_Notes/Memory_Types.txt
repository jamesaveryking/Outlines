Memory Types:

-RAM - random access memory
	-most common type of memory
	-usually referred to when talking about memory upgrades
	-volatile
	-does not refer to hard drive or SSD storage
	-data and programs can only be used when moved to RAM
	
-ROM - read only memory
	-chips inside of computer that are static and never change
	-good place for BIOS - nothing can ever delete bios
	-types:
		-PROM: programmable read only memory - write once
		-EPROM: erasable programmable read only memory - write, erase, write again
		-EEPROM: electrically EPROM - flash memory and SSD, upgradable BIOS

-Static RAM (SRAM)
	-very fast, large memory therefore very expensive
	-takes up more room on motherboard than other memory types
	-used around or off CPU as processor caches
		-levels referred to L1, L2, and L3

-Dynamic RAM (DRAM)
	-RAM we know and love
	-needs constant refreshing, without refreshing data in memory disappears
	-random access - any storage location can be accessed directly
		-unlike magnetic tape that has specified memory locations
		-instant access to memory addresses
		
-Single Data Rate (SDR) Synchronous DRAM (SDRAM) - 168 pins
	-synchronous with the common system clock
	-queues up one process while waiting for another
	-classic DRAM doesn't wait for a clock signal
	-other computer components can anticipate what happens based on clock
	-don't confuse SDRAM with SRAM
		-SDRAM module
	
-Clock cycles:
	-cycles rise and fall with each cycles
	-each cycle can transfer one piece of data in single data rate
	
-Double Data Rate Memory (DDR SDRAM)
	-sends data on rising and falling of clock - twice as much as SDR
	-same clock speed
	-184 pins
	-memory can be total throughput available or total transfers per second
	-DDR-200 = 200 million transfers/second
		-multiple by 8 to get throughput in megabytes per second
		-200*8 = PC1600 = DDR-200
	-DDR transfers twice the amount of data as SDR by utilizing both polarities of clock cycle (rise and fall)
	-DDR Speeds:
		-memory clock speed: how fast clock inside of memory itself
		-I/O bus clock speed: speed of bus outside of memory (what it is connected to)
		-DDR speed: transfers per second (= 2* memory clock speed = 2*I/O bus speed)? could be just in example
		-Transfer rate = DDR speed*8
		-Module name = PC(transfer rate as a number)
		
-DDR2 SDRAM
	-twice as fast as DDR
	-240 pins
	-not backwards compatible
	-DDR2 won't work in DDR slots
	-DDR Speed for DDR2 = 2*I/O Bus Clock Speed = 4*Memory Clock speed
						-speed change occurs between I/O Bus Clock Speed = DDR Speed / 2 (DDR2 implies I/O Bus Clock Speed multiplied by 2)
	-DDR Speed = million transfers/second
	-Transfer Rate = DDR Speed * 8
	-Module Name = PC2-(transfer rate number)
	
-DDR3 SDRAM
	-twice as fast as DDR2 with same clock rate in memory chips
	-larger memory capacity
	-240 pins
	-not backwards compatible with DDR2 - does not physically or programmatically fit
	-I/O Bus Clock Speed = 4*memory clock speed
	-DDR Speed = 2*I/O Bus Clock Speed
	-transfer rate is still equal to DDR Speed *8
	-Module Name = PC3-(transfer rate number)

-DDR, DDR2, DDR3 comparisons:
	-Memory Clock Speed = 100MHz
	-DDR: I/O Bus Clock Speed = 100MHz, DDR Speed = DDR-200, transfers/second = 200, transfer rate = 1600, module name = PC1600
	-DDR2: I/O Bus Clock Speed = 200MHz, DDR Speed = DDR-400, transfers/second = 400, transfer rate = 3200, module name = PC2-3200
	-DDR3: I/O Bus Clock Speed = 400MHz, DDR Speed = DDR-800, transfers/second = 800, transfer rate = 6400, module name = PC3-6400
	
Understanding PC Memory:
-memory that checks itself - used on critical computer systems (VM servers, database servers, any servers)
	-parity memory - adds parity bit to byte
		-how parity works:
			-bit makes an even number across all bit in byte
			-counts number of active bits - if even parity bit is 0, if odd parity bit is 1 to make parity even always
			-determining valid or error - count number inside of bytes and determine if parity bit makes number of active bits even:
				00100101 - PB:1 --> valid, 4 bits, even
				00000011 - PB:0 --> valid, 2 bits, even
				00010000 - PB:0 -->invalid, 1 bit, odd
				00001110 - PB:0 -->invalid, 3 bits, odd
		-won't always detect an error and can't correct error
	-error correcting code (ECC)
		-detects errors and corrects on the fly
		-not all systems use ECC - used on larger enterprise systems
		-looks identical to non-ECC memory
-registered memory - includes buffer between memory itself and memory controller
	-used on servers and systems with stable operating environment
	-rare on laptops or desktops
	-additional chips between RAM module and memory controller
	-common to be coupled with ECC in high-end system
-multi-channel memory - installed in pairs or trios to maximize throughput
	-memory combinations should match, ideally by type
	-often color coded - colors need to match
	-maximize throughput by gouping in colors
-single sided vs. double-sided memory:
	-interpretations:
		-chips on one side of module and not other or on both sides of module
		-ranks (seperations on module) of memory - seperate ranks can be called sides
			-memory module with two ranks can be described as double-sided
		-clarify description of physical package or ranks
-finding the right memory - tight tolerance, need exact number for motherboard
	-refer to motherboard documentation
		-ex. 4 x DIMM, max 32GB, DDR31600/1300MHz, non-ECC, un-buffered memory
		-online guides go by make and model of computer - cross reference with motherboard documentation
		-lots of options (in example DDR3 1600 OR DDR3 1333MHz)
