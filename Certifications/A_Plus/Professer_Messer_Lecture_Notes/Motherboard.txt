Motherboard

-distinguishing characteristics determine motherboards
	-physical size can determine case sizing
	-basic layout - room for small changes
	-power interfaces - standard connectors regardless of type of motherboard
	-airflow - increasingly important - chip sets and CPUS heat up over time
	-40 different types of motherboards on wikipedia
-A+ cert focuses on:
	-Standard ATX
	-Micro ATX
	
-Other types:
	-Mini-ITX
	-Nano-ITX
	
-ATX form factor (advanced technology extended):
	-standardized by Intel in 1995
	-power: 20 pin or 24 pin connector, additional 4/8 pin connector
	-port types:
		-optional I/O backplate
		-add and remove as needed
	-ATX motherboards still manufactures in 2015
	-typically largest form factor
	
-Micro-ATX:
	-limited expansion slots due to size
	-backward compatability to ATX: similar mounting points/power
	-very popular form factor - still manufactured in 2015

-ITX:
	-series of low-power motherboards created by VIA technologies in 2001
	-Mini-ATX is screw-compatible to ATX and micro-ATX	
	-single use motherboard (streaming media, security system, etc.)
	-Nano, Pico, Mobile ITX is part of families
	
Expansion slots/bus speeds:
-Bus architecture:
	-communication path
	-internal PC growth
	-system expansion with additional capabilities
	
-Expansion Bus:
	-"width" of expansion bus: changing to bandwidth (how much traffic can be pushed through connection)
	-clock speed of the bus - every bus has its own clock
		-speed: cycles/second measured in hertz - 1MHz = 1 million cycles per second
	-clock speed does not necessarily equal transfer rate
		-data transfer can be above memory clock speed
		
-Convential PCI (peripheral component interconnect):
	-common expansion interface (32-bit and 64-bit bus width)
	-communicates in parallel mode: all bits transferred simultaneously
	-throughput varies by bus version
	
-Northbridge (Memory Controller hub)
-Southbridge (I/O controller hub) -- USB, ethernet, IDE, SATA, etc.
	-for 64-bit PCI parallel bus 64-bit PCI expansion slot is necessary

-32 and 64 bit slots are different to fit different cards
	-example support 3.3V connection or 5V connection, notch could specify number of bits in notch

-PCI X - eXtended
	-based on PCI, built for servers
	-higher bandwidth - four-time the clock speed
	-built to handler higher-speed network and storage
	-1064 MB/s throughput
	-parallel communication
	-DO NOT confuse with PCI-Express
	
-PCI Express - PCIe
	-also known as PCIe
	-replaced PCI, PCI-X, and AGP (Accelerate Graphics Port)
	-modern replacement
	-more flexibility on motherboard communication
	-communicates serially - sends one bit at a time from one side to the other
	-unidirectional serial lanes
	-x1,x4,x8,x16,x32 full-duplex (both directions simultaneously) lanes
		-x is pronounced "by" - x1 is by 1
	-all lanes bi-directional to allow data transmission in both directions
	-different versions of PCIe:
		-v1.x: 250MB/s / lane
		-v2.x: 500MB/x / lane
		-v3.x: ~1GB/s / lane
		-v4.x: ~2GB/s / lane (2016)
		
-Mini PCI and PCI Express
	-made for laptops and mobile devices
	-expande features of laptops (wifi, mobile broadband, etc.)
	-no access to the card - inside laptop and cannot be touched
	
-RAM Slots:
	-changed greatly over time driven by standardization and technology
	-different types of memory and memory connections
	-one of the most important components of computer
	-speed is key
	-every motherboard is different in terms of memory access speed - always reference documentation
-DIMM - dual inline memory module:
	-electrical contacts are different on each side
	-everything is in one single line of a chip set
	-each side is different set of contacts
	-64 bit data width
	-different types:
		-DDR SDRAM - 184 pines
		-DDR2/3 SDRAM - 240 pins
-SO-DIMM - small outline dual in-line memory module
	-typically in laptops, mobile devices 68mm x 32mm
	-DDR and DDR2 SDRAM - 200 pins
	-DDR3 SDRAM - 204 pins
	-notch designates type of memory 
	
-Micro-DIMM
	-used for smaller mobile devices (54mm x 30mm)
	-DDR - 172 pins
	-DDR2/3 - 214 pins

Motherboard Chipsets
-everything begins or ends on the motherboard
-sometimes referred to as mobo
-standard sizes, constant change in chipsets, bus speeds, cooling methods
-focus on Northbridge/Southbridge

-Northbridge: memory controller hub
	-connects CPU to memory and high speed graphics card
	-high bandwidth communication
	-modern computers include cooling sinks/fans

-Southbridge: all other connection management
	-PCI interface slots
	-Other peripherals (USB, ethernet)
	-Onboard graphics
	-BIOS
	-Allows northbridge to primarily control memory by controlling all other connections

-Always refer to motherboard manual
-Super I/O handles serial port, parallel port, floppy, mouse, lower bandwidth peripherals

-Chipset Evolution:
	-nothing stays the same, it's all about speed
	-more functions moving into the CPU - eliminates extra busses by including in CPU and alleviating pressure on seperate northbridge
	-modern processors: processor cores, memory controller, GPU
	
Jumpers and Connectors
-wires go to buttons on case according to correct spot (speaker, reset button, etc.)
-jumpers enable or disable certain features of motherboard - refer to documentation
	-plastic pieces can placed over one pin in jumper to effectively disable
	-when piece connects both pins of jumper it is enabled to disable portion of motherboard
		-could disable port, set bus speed, reset BIOS, etc.
-most motherboards have standard connections to wires for reset buttons, interfaces for peripherals or other parts of computer, etc.
-always refer to motherboard documentation
