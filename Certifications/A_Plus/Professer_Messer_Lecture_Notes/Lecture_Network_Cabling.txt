Network Cablings

Fiber communications -- transmitted by light instead of radio frequencies
	-no radio frequency signal -- difficult to tap
	-signal slow to degrade -- transmits long distances
	-immune to radio or electrical interference potential
	-cable layout:
		-core, coating, orange cladding
	-very fragile -- center of ferrule wrapped around core
	-distancing:
		-short range (up to 2km) -- multi-mode fiber
		-long range (up to 100km without signal regeneration) -- single mode fiber
			-expensive light source -- laser beams

Twisted pair copper cabling:
	-balanced pair operation -- two wires with equal and opposite signals
	-interference can be filtered out
	-constant twisting allows easier comparison to determine interference
	-pairs in same cable are twisted at different rate
Unshielded and shielded cable:
	-unshielded twisted pair -- no additional shielding
	-most common twisted pair cabling
	-shielded twisted pair -- additiona shielding
		-requires use of electrical ground
		-common to see in place with radio interference or hard-hat work setting
Plenum-rated cable:
	-cable jacket -- fluorinated ethylene polymer (FEP) with low-smoke polyvinyl chloride (PVC)
		-minimizes smoke in fire
	-may not be as flexible
	-consider in worst case planning
Coaxial cable:
	-wire conductor, dielectric insulator, metal shielding, plastic jacket
	-two or more forms share common axis
	-RG-6 used in television/digital cable and usually internet into building
	-RG-59 used as patch inside bulding short distance
