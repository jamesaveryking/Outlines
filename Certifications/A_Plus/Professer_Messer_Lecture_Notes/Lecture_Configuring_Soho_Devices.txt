Configuring Small Office Home Office Devices

-multifunction devices
	-printer, scanner, fax, network connection, phone line connection, print from web
	-there are a lot of potentials to go wrong
-printer drivers -- specific to a printer model
	-get this exactly right
	-get the right operating system drivers
		-Vista,7,8,8.1 could all be different
		-check manufacturer website
	-check OS version -- 32/64 drivers
		-not backwards compatible to smaller number of bits
-duplex
	-printing on both sides of page at one time
	-not duplex -- manual switch
	-not all printers can do this
	-collate
		-print multiple copies in their proper order
		-non-callated -- 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3
		-collated -- 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3
-orientation
	-portrait vs landscape
	-paper doesn't rotate -- printer compensates
	-quality -- resolution, color, greyscale, color saving
-wired device sharing
	-USB type B most common
	-USB B on printer, A on computer
	-parallel -- legacy systems
		-centronics interface on the printer
		-DB-25 on the computer
	-ethernet -- RJ45 connector
-wireless device sharing
	-bluetooth -- limited range
	-802.11 a/b/g/n/ac infrastructure mode
		-many devices using an access point
	-802.11 Ad hoc mode
		-no access point
		-direct link between wireless devices
-integrated print server
	-print directly to printer
	-jobs queued on printer
	-jobs managed on the printer
		-web based front end or client utility
	-new support cloud printing -- access anywhere in world
-TCP
	-connect via TCP port number
	-common on windows devices
	-uses TCP and UDP ports 135-139
-Bonjour
	-discover apple devices on the LAN
	-part of Mac OS
	-can be added to windows (itunes etc.)
-Airprint
	-print from iOS devices to compatible printers
-printer device privacy
	-user authentication
		-every, set rights/permissions, printing/managing device
	-print and scan caching
		-usually spool file is created on printer and deleted when done
			-not always -- need to delete if sensitive
