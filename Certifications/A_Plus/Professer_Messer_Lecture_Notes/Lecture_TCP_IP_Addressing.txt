TCP/IP Addressing

-ingredients to address:
	-IP address
		-every device needs unique IP
	-subnet mask -- same numbers
		-lets local workstation know the network it belongs to
		-usually not transmitted across network
		-used locally instead of public IP to access network
	-default gateway -- IP address associated with router on local network
		-communicates with internet
-domain name system:
	-translates human-readable names into computer-readable IP addresses
	-distributed database distributed worldwide
		-13 root servers
		-100s of top level domains
		-over 275 country codes
	-IP addresses of DNS servers provided by network admin
		-usually given two for redundancy
-static addressing -- configuring all addresses manually in computer
-configuring DHCP:
	-ip address configuration used to be status
	-dynamic host configuration protocol automatically assigns this now
		-IP address, subnet mask, default gateway
		-usually configured separately from DNS
-classless subnetting
	-classless inter-domain routing (CIDR)
		-created around 93
		-removed restrictions created by classful subnet mask
		-cider block notation
	-subnet can be described as decimal (98.0.0.0) or CIDR notation (/14)
	-usually provided IP, subnet, default gateway, and DNS by OS
