Calculating Signal Loss

-usually gradual -- signal strength diminishes over distance
-attenuation -- loss of intensity as signal moves through medium
-electrical signals through copper, light through fiber, radio through air
-Decibels -- one/tenth of a bell (alexander graham bell)
	-logarithmic scale
	-add/subtract losses and gains
	-signal strength ratio measurements
	ex) 3dB = 2x signal
		10dB = 10x signal
		20dB = 100x signal 
		30dB = 1000x signal
-calculating involves addition and subtraction
	-add the loss through each section
	
	ex) manufacturer has specific dB loss of each section
		-add loss as X per section used
		-create ratios for smaller segments -- remember logarithmic relationship
		-add patch panel loss at beginning and end

-dB loss symptoms -- no connectivity, intermittent connectivity
	-poor performance -- CRC data corrupted 
	-test each connection -- test distance and signal loss
