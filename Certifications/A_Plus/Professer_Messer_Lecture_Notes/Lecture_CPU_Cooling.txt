CPU Cooling

-Heat Sink
	-dissipate heat through thermal conduction
	-metal (aluminum || copper base) placed on top of hot part of motherboard
	that cools part by increasing surface area with ridges on top and cooling
	down when in contact with cool air
	-thermal paste creates a good contact between the chip and the heat sink
	-they get hot -- do not touch them
	-right amount of thermal paste on CPU -- small dab in the middle
	-often common to include fan right on top of hink sink -- fans usually plug into CPU fan on motherboard
-On-board fans
	-designed to cool an entire adapter card
	-can be bulky -- may take additional adapter card space
	-usually seen on high-end adapter cards
	-seen usually on graphics cards with lots of cycles
-Case Fans
	-physically connected to case of computer to create air flow
	-motherboard layout becomes important
	-component location is key to allow air to best pass through and not be obstructed by devices, wiring, power
-Fan specifications:
	-80mm, 120mm, 200mm
	-different speeds: variable speeds based on temp
	-different noise levels
-Liquid Coolant:
	-coolant is circulated through a computer
		-not a new concept - automobiles, mainframes
	-high-end systems
	-gaming, graphics systems
	-useful with overclocking
	-usually done in closed system connected to CPU
		-usually two connections (in/out)
		-usually fan close by
-Modern devices use passive cooling
	-no fans, silent operation
	-specialized functions -- video servers, tv set box, satellite receiver
	-functions are very controlled and carefully measured by thermal tests
	-minimize power use, maximize heat sinks
