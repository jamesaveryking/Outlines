CPU Socket Types

Intel and AMD architectures

Intel:
	-Intel LGA 775 -- 775 pins, land grid array package - all pins on motherboard
		-Also called Socket T -- named for cancelled Tejas core
		-circa 2004
			-seen in later-version Pentium 4, Intel Core 2 Duo, Xeon, and Celeron
	-Intel LGA 1366 -- 1366 pins, land grid array package - Also called Socket B
		-replaced LGA 775
		-Circa 2008 - used by intel core i7
	-Intel LGA 1156 LGA -- Socket H or Socket H1
		-also replaced LGA 775
		-Released 2009
		-integrates northbridge onto the chip
	-Intel LGA 1155 -- Socket H2
		-single pin difference from 1156
		-built to replace 1156
		-not compatible to 1156
		-released in 2011
		-supports Intel sandy bridge and ivy bridge CPU microprocessors
	-Intel LGA 1150 -- Socket H3
		-replacement for LGA 1155
		-released in 2013
		-used by Haswell and Broadwell micro-architecture
	-Intel LGA 2011 -- Socket R
		-replaced LGA 1366 and LGA 1567
		-released November 2011
		-designed for high-end desktop and server
			-sandy bridge E/EP and Ivy Bridge E/EP
				-Enthusiast and Xeon Class
AMD -- all Pin Grid Array (PGA) and not identified numerically:
	-AMD Socket AM3
		-941 pins on socket
		-PGA-ZIF package
		-replaces the AM2/AM2+
		-released 2009
		-similar in size to AM2/AM2
		-generally backwards compatible with BIOS upgrade
	-AMD Socket AM3+
		-942 pins on socket
		-PGA-ZIF package
		-one more pin than AM3
		-released 2011
		-use and AM3 processor in an AM3+ motherboard
		-using AM3+ in AM3 boards is not supported by AMD
	-AMD socket FM1
		-905 pins
		-released 2011
			-supports AMD 10h CPU architecture
			-supports AMD A-Series processors
				-faster speeds
				-DDR3 Support
				-Integrated PCle 2.0 controller into CPU
	-AMD Socket FM2
		-904 pins
		-PGA-ZIF package
		-September 2012 release
			-piledriver CPU architecture
		-similar to FM1 -- one pin difference
		-not backwards compatible to FM1
	-AMD Socket FM2+
		-906 pins -- two more than FM2
		-Micro PGA-ZIF package
		-also called socket FM2b
		-two more pins than FM2
		-not backwards compatible because of additional pins and pin configuration
		-released January 2014
			-steamroller CPU architecture
