Network Connectors

Three kinds of fiber connectors:

-ST connector -- straight tip connector
	-bayonet connection
-SC connector -- subscriber, standard or square connector 
	-no bayonet
-LC connector -- lucent, local, or little connector

Copper:
-RJ11 -- 6 position, 2 conductor (6P2C)
	-RJ14 uses 6P4C with dual-line uses
	-telephone connection
	-two phone lines on single cable
-RJ45 -- 8 positions  8 conductors (8P8C)
	-modular connection
	-similar in shape to RJ48C
	-8P4C used with T1/WAN data lines

-wiring standards:
	-cables can foul up a good plan
	-many connectors look alike
	-always maintain consistency when managing different connections

-T568A and T568B termination
	-EIA/TIS-568-B standard
		-eight conductor 100-ohn balanced twisted-pair cabling
	-T568A and T568B are different pins assignments for 8P8C connectors
	-assigns the T568A pin-out to horizontal cabling
	-many organizations use 568B
		-difficult to change in mid-stream
	-you can't terminate one side with 568A and the other with 568B
-BNC connector -- bayonet neill-councelman
	-coaxial cable connector -- DS3 WAN links
	-rigid and bulky -- can be difficult to work with
-F-connector
	-cable television, cable modem
	-RG-6 cable -- threaded connected -- additional internet conenction
