Understanding CPU Characteristics

Processor Speed
-Real Speed: CPU clock
	-historical qualification of speed
	-older - MHz, or newer - GHz
-Actual Speed
	-combination of different factors
		-clock speed, CPU architecure, bus speed, bus width, L1 cache size
		L2 cache size, OS capabilities
-emphasis in performance is no longer based on speed - subjective based on computing need (data science, security, etc.)
-early processors:
	-single CPU core with one set of calculations
-modern processors:
	-additional cores
	-ex) quad-core with different caches attached to each core individually or collectively
	-octa-core and 16-core CPUs exist
-lots of components now included into CPU
	-CPU die:
		-processor graphics, multiple cores (Each with L1 or L2 cache) and shared L3 cache
		memory controller I/O
-CPU cache:
	-extremely fast memory
	-dramatically increase amount of throughput in CPUs	
	-hold instructions, data results, etc.
	-L1 cache - first storage area integrated to main CPU core
	-L2 cache - secondary data 
	-L3 cache - usually shared across multiple cores
-Hyper-threading technology(HTT): takes single CPU and makes it work as two CPU to improve performance
	-increases amount of information going through CPU
	-15-30% improvement outside of HTT on OS
	-supported by OS of Window XP and later typically
-Virtualization
	-run other operating systems within a single hardware platform
	-multiple OS's shared by one physical hardware component
	-software is typically limited by hardware shared
	-when added to processor: hardware is faster and easier to manage, Intel - intel virtualization technology (IVT), AMD Virtualization - (AMD-V)
-32 vs 64 bits
	-data "width"
	-total amount of available data to process at a given time
	-64 
		-larger data path, variable sizes, memory addresses
		-larger bus moves more data
	-data bus can be larger than CPU (64 bit buts, 32 bit CPU)
	-software must be optimized to the number of available bits
		-OS, drivers, applications
-Integrated Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)
	-can be integrated into CPU itself
		-this optimizes graphics sub-systems
		-requires a lot of work to process all graphics
		-not as powerful as having seperate graphics adapter
-NX bit 
	-security function
	-No-eXecute bit
		-Intel - XD bit (eXecutable Disable)
		-AMD cals it Enhanced Virus Protection
	-Designate secitons of memor as executing code or data
		-code can't run from protected memory locations
		-prevents malware and viruses from executing
	-OS must support this feature
		-windows calls it Data Execution Prevention (DEP)
		-Usually enabled automatically as default
	-keeps all executable code running in its own space
