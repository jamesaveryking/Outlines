Common Network Protocols

-dynamic host configuration protocol
	-automated configuration of ip address, subnet mask, and other
	-udp/67 and udp/68
	-requires dhcp server
	-dynamic -- ip addresses are assigned in real-time from a pool
	-static -- addresses are assigned by MAC address in the DHCP server
		-quickly readress servers from one remote location
-domain name system
	-converts names to IP addresses -- udp/53
	-critical resources -- usually multiple servers on network
-lightweight directory access protocol (LDAP)
	-protocol for reading/writing directories over IP network
		-organized set of records like phone directory
	-X.500 specification was written by the international telecommunications union (ITU)
	-LDAP ran on the OSI protocl stack
		-LDAP is lightweight and uses TCP/IP -- tcp/389 and udp/389
	-protocl used to query and update X.500 directory
	-attribute = value pairs
	-most specific attribute listed first
-simple network management protocol
	-gather statistic from network devices
	-udp/161
	-common -- management device to query number of bytes received to interface on router
	-v1 -- original -- no encryption
	-v2 -- data type enhancement, bulk transfers
	-v3 -- message integrity, authentication, encryption
-server message block
	-protocol used by microsoft also called common internet file system (CIFS)
	-using netbios over tcp/ip
		-udp/137 -- netbios name services (nbname) -- locate devices on network by name
		-udp/138 -- netbios datagram service (nbdatagram)
		-udp/139 -- netbios session service (nbsession)
	-direct over tcp/445
-ssh -- encrypted terminal session
	-encrypted communcation link -- tcp/22
-apple filing protocol (AFP)
	-tcp/548 -- transfer files to other mac over local network
	-works with service location protocol (SLP) -- tcp/427 and udp/427
		-populates list of available devices
	-file managemet -- copy, move, delete files
