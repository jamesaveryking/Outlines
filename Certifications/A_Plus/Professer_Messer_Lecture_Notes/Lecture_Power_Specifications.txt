Computer Power Specifications

-Amp and Volt and Watt

-Amp -- ampere - rate of electron flow past a point in a second
-Volt -- voltage - electrical "pressure" pushing electrons through connection
	-water hose metaphor:
		-size of hose increases amps
		-increasing tap output increases water pressure
-Watt - measurements of real power use
	-volts * amps = watts
	-120V * 0.5A = 60W

-Current
	-Alternating Current (AC) ~~~~~
		-direction of current is constantly changing
		-efficient on long distances
		-frequency of this cycle is important
			-US/Canada -- 110 to 120V of AC(VAC), 60 hertz (Hz)
			-Europe -- 220 to 240 Volts Alternating Current, 50Hz
	-Direct Current --------
					_ _ _ _
	
		-power that is converted out of power lines into household appliances
		-moves in one direction with a constant voltage
-Voltage rails
	-single rail
		-single 12 volt rail power supply
		-one output circuit generating 12 volts
	-multiple rails
		-multiple 12 volt rail power supply
		-each 12 volt rail has separate circuitry inside of the power supply
		-each 12 volt connector on the outside of the power supply is connected to one of the rails
	-multiple rails provide additional protection
		-higher power overload of a single rail means there's a lot of smoke
		-overloading smaller capacity rails shuts down the power supply unit instead
		
-Sizing power supply
	-bigger isn't necessarily better - more cost, no more speed
	-physical size is relatively standard
	-calculate and combine watts required for all components to see maximimum amount of power necessary
		-many online calculators
	-video adapters are usually the largest power draw
		-many video card specifications list a recommended power supply wattage
	-good rule of thumb -- get 2 times the maximum power needed
-Power supply connectors:
	-Fixed
		-connected to the power supply
		-may have too many connectors
		-may not have enought
	-Modular
		-all cables as needed
		-fewer leftover wires, better airflow
		-a bit more expensive

-Modern Power Supplies:
	-ATX and microATX power supplies
	-power supply dimensions are standardized
		-most power supplies fit in ATX and microATX cases
	-some older power supplies are physically larger - microATX may not be an option
	-some microATX cases minimize size -- may require specific power supply

-Dual-voltage options:
	-voltages vary by country (US/Canada 110-120VAC 60Hz, Europe 220-240VAC 50Hz)
	-manually switch between US/Canada and Europe standards
	-check using voltage meter
	-NEVER cross over power supplies that are not configured to voltage
	-power supply will specify voltage range
