Storage Device Overview

-Optical Formats:
	-small bumps read with laser beam
	-microscopic binary scan
	-CD-ROM (compact disk ROM) - up to 700 MB
	-DVD-ROM (digital versatile disc) - 4.7GB single layer, 8.5 GB dual layer
	-Blu-ray Disc - 25 GB for single-layer, 50GB for dual-layer
-Writing to optical media:
	-burners don't creat bumps
	-the darken photosensitive dye
	-CD-RW (rewritable)
	-DVD-R/RW (read and rewritable)
	-BD-R
	-BD-RE (blu-ray disk recordable erasable)
-Hard disk drive
	-rotations range 5400rpm-10000rpm
	-faster drives, lower latency to grab data
	-platter is spinning portion
	-actuator connect to arm
	-end of arm - read/write head to access/create information
	-hard drive is large storage device, limited by speed of access to information
-SSD - solid state drive
	-flash memory coupled to computer for long-term storage
	-no moving parts
	
-Hybrid Drive (Solid State Hybrid Drive (SSHD))
	-both spinning drive and SSD in single device
	-SSD caches info in reading/writing to hard drive
	-increased performance and lower cost with smaller SSD in hybrid package
	-SSD is attatched to same form factor as normal hard drive

-Hot swappable drive:
	-add or remove during run time
	-example: USB
	-FireWire drive connected using FireWire cable
	-SATA, eSATA (external) - slide into or disconnect from array during run time
	
-USB flash drive - flash memory EEPROM
	-nonvolatile memory - does not require constant power
	-limited number of writes - can still read without writing after certain point
	-easy to lose or damage - always have a backup
	-Formats:
		-USB flash drive
		-CompactFlash (CF)
		-Secure Digital (SD)
		-xD-Picture Card (older digital cameras)
		-EMMC - mobile device flash memory
-Tape Drive:
	-stores info sequentially
	-stores large amount of data
	-various sizes
	-relatively inexpensive and easy to ship/stores
	-LTO (linear tape open (Ultrium for factor)) format to store info on tapes
