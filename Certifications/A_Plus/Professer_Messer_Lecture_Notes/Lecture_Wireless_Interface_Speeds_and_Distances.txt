Wireless Interface Speeds and Distances

Many different ways to connect mobile devices/computers without wires

-Infrared:
	-standard from the IrDA (Infrared Data Association)
	-4 megabit/second speed, line of sight
	-1 meter distance limitation
	-laptop, phone, camera

-NFC (near field communications)
	-106 kilobit/second, 212 kilobit/second, 424 kilobit/second
	-range of 10cm (3.9 inches) or less
	-mobile devices, payment devices, ticketing, gaming
	
-Bluetooth radios
	-categorized into classes:
		-class 1 - industrial use -- max power = 100 milliWatt -- range = 100 meters
		-class 2 - used in many mobile devices -- 2.5 milliWatt -- 10 meters
		-class 3 - short-range use  -- 1 milliWatt -- 1 meter
-Bluetooth versions
	-1.2 in 1995 -- faster connection and recovery -- data rate = 1 megabit/second
	-2.0 + enhanced data rate (and 2.1 + EDR) -- 3 megabit/second
	-3.0 + high speed --24 megabit/second
		-used for negotiation and establishment
		-802.11 used for the actual data transfer
	-4.0 includes lower power specification -- 24 megabit/second

	-802.11 networking common for wireless transmission -- see picture
