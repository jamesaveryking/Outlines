32 Launching an RDS instance lab and backing up
-edit security groups to allow traffic from existing security groups on port 3306
-see zipped files to upload bootstrap script
-always allow 3306 in RDS security group and allow database traffic in security group that it is contained in
-backups in RDS: automated and snapshots
	-automated backups allow for backup at any point in time during a retention period - default is 7 days
		-take a full daily snapshots and transaction logs throughout the day
		-allows point in time recovery down to a second
		-one to one storage space in s3
		-do this backup when there is not heavy traffic
		-stored even after original backup is deleted
	-with both auto and snapshots, restored version of database is always a new RDS instance with a new endpoint
	-encryption supported for mysql, oracle, mysql server, postgresql, and mariadb done via key management service
	-restorations can be full or point in time
-multi a-z: RDS instances uses synchronous replication into different availabilty zones
	-same DNS endpoint using failover policy
	-for disaster recovery only, not improving performance (used in read replica)
-read replica: used for improving performance
	-uses asynchronous replication to have an exact copy of database that can be read from
	-used when there is a read-heavy workload
	-change connection strings on EC2 instances to different read-replicas or read-replicas of read-replicas (up to 5 copies in scaling out)
	-read-only copy of production database
	-syncing delays and higher latency with more read-replicas
	-to create, select desired DB, click instance actions, select create read replica
-know read-replica vs. multi a-z
	-rr is for scaling and read-intensive workloads
	-a-z is for disaster recovery
	-rr can be created from multi a-z
	-rr can be promoted to a db instance
	-rr is read only
	-rr can be in a second region
-difference between dynamodb and rds
	-scaling
		-in rds it isn't automatic, requires manual intervention, can only really scale up
			-use a difference instance size or read-replica
		-automatic scaling -- dynamodb
