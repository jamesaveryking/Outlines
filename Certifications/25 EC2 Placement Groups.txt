25 EC2 Placement Groups
placement groups: logical grouping of instances within a single AZ
	-using them enables applications to participate in low latency, 10 Gb/s networks
	-benefits in low latency, high network throughput or both
	-used in grid computing (hadoop cluster)
-placement groups can't span multiple AZ's
	-one AZ goes down it all goes down
-the name of a placement group must be unique within an AWS account
-only certain types of instances can be launched in a placement group compute optimized, gpu memory optimized, storage instances
	-recommended to only launch homogenously (same size and family of instances)
-cannot be merged, can create AMI from existing instances and launch new instance from AMI into placement group
