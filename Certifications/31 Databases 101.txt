-5 different services available for databases in AWS
what is a relational database? -- read FAQs
	-traditional spreadsheet metaphor: file name is db name, tables are columns, primary key is represented by a unique valued column
	-relational db types:
		-sql server, oracle, mysql server, postgresql, aurora, mariadb
non-relational databases:
	-mongoDB, couchDB, dynamoDB (document oriented DB)
	-database: collection (table), document (row), key-value pairs (value)
		-can be address with a key-value pair
data warehousing:
	-used for business intelligence
	-used to pull in large/complex data sets used by management to see current performance vs. targets, etc.
	-uses different architecture
online transaction processing vs. online analytics processing
	-transaction: pulls up record set by primary key
	-analytics: pulls in large number of records 
		-example: figure out net profit of product
			-pulls in different sums, sales prices, etc. from different regions
elasticache:
	-allows faster output for caching in cloud memory
	-asked to improve DB performance speed in questions
	-caches most consistently queried parts of database
database migration services:
	-allows migration of production database to AWS, AWS manages complexities of migration process (data typing, replication during migration process)
	-allows sources database to be migrated to different target database
		-switch from oracle to something else that is open source
Summary:
	-RDS -- online transaction processing, SQL, MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, Aurora, MariaDB
		-multi a-z
			-ELBs point to same RDS instance using DNS name
			-automatically replicated to another AZ
			-automatic failover between replications in different AZ's
			-simulated failover by stopping instance
		-read-replica
			-if application is frequently reading, can read from read-replicas and write to main DB
			-can have up to 5 read replicas and read replicas of read replicas
		-aurora autoscaling
			-2 copies of your data store in each AZ
			-minimum of 3 AZs
			-self-healing
			-2 types of replicas
				-aurora (up to 15)
				-mysql (up to 5)
	-DynamoDB - No SQL
		-push-button scaling, easier than provision instances in RDS
		-stored on SSD storage
		-spread across 3 geographically distinct data centers
		-eventual consistency for reads (default)
		-strongly consistent reads -- under 1 second
	-Redshift - online analytics processing
		-data warehousing
		-single node or multi node
			-multi: leader and compute nodes (up to 120)
	-elasticache - in memory caching, caching common queries
		-memcached
		-reddis
