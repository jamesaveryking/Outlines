26 EFS concepts and lab
efs: elastic file system, file storage service for amazon elastic compute cloud
-storage capacity is elastic, growing and shrinking automatically as files are added / removed
-cannot mount an ebs volume to two ec2 instances
	-solved with efs
-uses NFSv4 
-only pay for memory in use
-scales up to petabytes
-data stored across multiple AZ's in region
-can support multiple concurrent NFS connections
-efs is block based instead of object based
-similar to s3 in read after write consistency

methodology:
-select AZ, VPC, and mount targets
-choose subnets
-choose security groups
-add tags and review

-launch two EC2 instances
-provision a load balancer
	-default VPC with same security group
-add in both EC2 instances to load balancer
-write down public IPs of both EC2 instances to get into them
-instances MUST be in the same security group as the new EFS
-install apache in both instances and start
-go into EFS and click file system mount instructions
	-run command to mount instances to EFS directory but change so that it mounts to var/www/html
-type in something to var/www/html and it should now appear in both instances 

exam tip:
-use case is for a file server as a centralized repository for multiple EC2 instances
-can apply user and directory level permissions to EFS
-EFS allows multiple EC2, EBS only allows one EC2 instance for connection
