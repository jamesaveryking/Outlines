27 Lambda
lambda: invention of server-less
-several questions on Lambda in exam
lambda encapsulates data centers, hardware, assembly code/protocol, high level
languages, operating systems, application layer/AWS API's, AWS Lambda
-all that you worry about is your code
-compute service where you upload code and create lambda function
	-event driven compute source
	-compute service to run code in response to HTTP request using API gateway
-event driven compute service as well as used for HTTP requests
	
methodology:
-upload meme to S3 triggers lambda function to store in s3 triggering additional lambda event returning
file location, triggering another lambda event copying file to another S3 around the world

-each instance of a lambda function is one instance of lambda running - multiple uploads invoke multiple instances
-lambda scales out automatically so you don't have to worry about ELB's
	-scaling out adds more and more instances
-main thing to remember: different types of lambda triggers
	-SNS, alexa, IoT, api gateway, etc see northern virginia lambda functions

-methodology:
	-navigate to lambda in AWS, create new function
	-select a blank one and choose N. Virginia (first rollout region)

-additional method:
	-user triggers HTTP request via site visit triggering API gateway triggering lambda function
		-three users connecting simultaneously trigger three lambda functions
		-one code responds with multiple instances to multiple requests
-one million free invocations per month
-languages supported: java, python, C#, node.js, with different versions respectively
-lambda is priced based on number of requests, 20 cents per million 
	-pay when someone requests, not by hour
	-also pay with memory allocated per function 
-duration has a maximum threshold of 5 minutes in lambda
-use case: speaking to alexa 
-summary:
	-scales out automatically
	-functions are independent ( 1 to 1 )
	-lambda is serverless
	-know what services are serverless
	-lambda functions can trigger other lambda functions (1 to x)
	-architecture can get complex -- use AWS x-ray
	-max duration 5 minutes
	-different languages
	-lambda is globally available
