44 SWF
simple workflow service
-could come up in exam as SQS vs SWF or ask what SWF stands for
-makes easier to coordinate work between distributed application components
-tasks represent processing steps that can be code, web service calls, human action, etc.
-media processing, web application back end, etc.
-key difference: SQS retention period is 14 days
	-SWF retention period up to 1 year
		-always answer for over 14 days
	-SWF is task oriented API, SQS is message oriented API
	-SWF ensures task is assigned only once and never duplicated
	-SWF keeps track of all tasks/events in application, SQS needs tracking for multiple queues custom made
-SWF actors:
	-starters: application initiating workflow (ecommerce site, mobile app, etc.)
	-deciders: control series of tasks in workflow execution (if this then that)
	-activity workers: carry out tasks
	-can involve humans or outside processes
